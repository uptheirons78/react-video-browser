# React Application: Video Browser from Youtube

This is my first attempt in learning React.js building a SPA to browse videos from Youtube website.

1 - In the "01_first_component" branch I create my first React component rendering it to the web page.
2 - In the "02_more_components_and_organization" branch I create the "components" folder with 4 different kind of component: search bar, video details, video list and video list items. I work on the two kinds of component: functional and class components. I also use user events handler inside the search bar component.
